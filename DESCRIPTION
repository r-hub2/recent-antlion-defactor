Description: Provides a set of functions to efficiently manage, annotate,
    and retrieve variable labels in data frames. This package allows for
    dynamic setting and extraction of labels based on patterns, column
    selections, or custom specifications. It is particularly useful for
    data cleaning, analysis, and preparation tasks where labeled data is
    critical for interpretation and reporting.
